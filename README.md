# chomp

Chomp is a pencil-and-paper territorial game for two players, played on a 3x4 grid representing a delicious chocolate bar. Players take it in turns to bite off rectangular regions from the lower right corner, aiming for the other player to eat the last square, which is tainted with a deadly neurotoxin. 

The game has a total of 34 states, which makes it a candidate for a simple machine-learning demonstration, in the same vein as the [MENACE](https://github.com/mscroggs/MENACE) machine.  

This may turn into an NGCM outreach demonstration if it turns out to be successful.
