[Chomp](http://www.papg.com/show?3AEA) is a pencil-and-paper territorial game for two players, conventionally played on a 3x4 grid representing a delicious chocolate bar. Players take it in turns to bite off rectangular regions from the lower right corner, aiming for the other player to eat the last square, which is tainted with a deadly neurotoxin.

With 3 rows and 4 columns, the game has a total of 34 states, which makes it a candidate for a simple machine-learning demonstration, in the same vein as the [MENACE](https://github.com/mscroggs/MENACE) machine.

The 50GamesHuman.pkl file contains the state of the machine after 50 games against a human, starting with 2 beads in each box. The 2000Games#.pkl files contain the machine state after facing a random opponent, or another 'intelligent' opponent using the same strategy. 

This may turn into an NGCM outreach demonstration if it turns out to be successful.
