Reflections on Machine Learning with Chomp at the Doctoral Research Showcase


- Event was 14:30-16:00, with a short setup time beforehand in which a few games were played against other exhibitors.
- Chomp was not reset after its last outing at Thomas Hardye School, so started the showcase with 76 games of training.
- During the showcase, 22 games were played, with 18 wins and 4 losses.
- The exhibit was situated in an "AI and Computing Futures" area next to a few posters with some intimidating mathematics. I started each demonstration with a promise to use no maths, no jargon and not even any computers.
- Introduced the game of chomp first by playing against punters myself - I told them I was a difficult opponent because I had played lots of times and learned some good strategies, this is what we were trying to "teach" the boxes.
- Had some good "oh!" moments from punters when reinforcing / penalising moves after completion of the games. Towards the end some boxes were clearly favouring one move over another, which people originally saw as unfair while playing, but understood later.
- Visitors to the festival were encouraged to fill in voting slips to judge the exhibits. Chomp was a joint winner of this "Peoples' Choice" award, presented by the VC at the end of the showcase.
